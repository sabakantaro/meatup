## 🎯 The Vision Behind Meatup

Meatup was born out of two essential motivations:

1. **Adapting to New Normal**: With the global pandemic limiting outdoor activities, home training and muscle workouts have become increasingly popular. Meatup offers a virtual platform for individuals to connect, share information, and support each other's fitness endeavors.

2. **Personalized Training**: Having experienced the challenges of finding the right muscle training method, I aimed to make it easier for others by creating a dedicated social media platform solely focused on muscle training. Meatup facilitates finding the perfect training approach tailored to individual needs and preferences.
